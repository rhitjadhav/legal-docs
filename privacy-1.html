                <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> We collect your 10-digit mobile number for user authentication via Firebase Phone Authentication (LoginActivity.java). This ensures your account is secure and uniquely identifiable.</li>

                <li><strong>Sales Data:</strong> All data you enter to create reports, including opening/closing nozzle readings, fuel rates, cash denominations, online payment totals (PhonePe, Card, Pinelap), credit sales details, and expense details (MainReportActivity.java, DieselReportActivity.java).</li>
                <li><strong>Generated Reports:</strong> The PDF reports created by the app, which contain a summary of all the data listed above, are stored securely.</li>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect solely to provide and improve the App's functionality:</p>

        <li>To allow Owners to invite and manage their DSMs (Daily Sales Men).</li>
        <li>To generate detailed daily sales reports in PDF format.</li>
        <li>To store and display historical report data for viewing and analysis.</li>
        <li>To pre-fill nozzle opening readings to streamline the report creation process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is of utmost importance to us.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All your app data (user profiles, sales data, report information) is stored securely on Google's Cloud Firestore.</li>
        <li>All generated PDF report files are stored in Google's Firebase Storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We rely on Google's robust security measures to protect your data. Access to your data is restricted by security rules that only allow authorized users to view or manage it.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h2>5. User Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Owners have the right to view all data associated with their pump, manage their DSMs, and delete reports (ViewReportsActivity.java, DsmManagerActivity.java).</li>
        <li>You can edit your profile information at any time within the app's "Profile Settings" (ProfileActivity.java).</li>
        <li>Owners can remove DSMs. When a DSM is removed, their profile is deleted from our active database (DsmAdapter.java).</li>
